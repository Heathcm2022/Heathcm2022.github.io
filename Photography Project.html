			<p><a ahref="">I took this picture at a Navigators retreat in Carlilse. I layed back in my hammock to get the verticle point-of-view. The only effect I used was the automatic glare reducer. There was no zoom, and it was taken as a still photo (as opposed to a live photo like I phones can take). </a></p>
			<img src="trees.jpg">
			<p><a>For this photo, I raised the brightness and the contrast to keep the distinction in the layers of the tree branches, but also make it pop more. I also adjusted the sharpness because when you used the contrast tool it makes it blury or pizelated sometimes, so adjusting the sharpness minorly can counteract that. I also used the brightening brush just in the middle there where the main source of light is.</a></p>

			<p><a>This picture was taken just before one of my bands gigs while we were setting up. I used my I phone 12s .5 camera so I could capture the set up of everything. I also used the auto adjust brightness setting so it wouldn’t glare off the cymbals of the guitar.</a></p>

			<p><a ahref="">This picture was taken in Hilton Head with my girlfriends I phone 13, using the standard camera. The phone was held so that it was just a few inches off the ground so we could catch the sun light and the reflection on the waves. The automatic brightness/glare adjuster was used just on the sun itself, with no other work done. </a></p>
			<img src="Hilton-head1.jpg">
			<p><a>I started out with adjusting the contrast to make the colors fade together more, to take away the darkness on the horizon line. I then use the brightening brush on the horison line and sky to bring out the blue and orange while keeping it calm. I very minorly adjusted the sharpnes using the unsharpen mask, just to make the bubbles more cutout and defined.</a></p>

			<p><a>For this photo, I used the sharpen tool to make the edges and depth of the room to pop. I cropped out the sound module on the right side. I also used the brighten tool on the cymbals and on the guitarist, since I used the glare reduction tool on my phone, then I could make them pop in post without risking glare. I adjusted the shadows there in the background as well as the coloring to make it more yellow and slightly brighter so that it contrasted color-wise, but that it wasn’t dark and looked creepy.</a></p>
